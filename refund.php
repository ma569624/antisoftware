                                <p><b> antisoftware.store</b> Due to the nature of digital distribution of active license codes, Bestantioffer cannot offer refunds or exchanges for products once delivered and activation/license key has been viewed. All licensing sales are final.</p>
                                <p><b>REFUNDS:</b> You may request a refund if you have not yet received the activation/license key from our system. If you have already retrieved the activation/license key, NO REFUNDS will be granted. Please make sure the software works on your system before retrieving the activation/license key.</p>
                                <p><b>CUSTOMER SATISFACTION:</b> The customer satisfaction metric is based on an online survey that all of our users are given the option of completing at the end of each repair session. Not all users complete this online survey. This metric is not based on a third-party audit by a market research firm specializing in customer satisfaction tracking studies. As such this metric may not be statistically accurate measurement of PC Safety Products customer satisfaction.</p>

                                    Currently it is our policy to not automatically renew our subscribers.</p>
